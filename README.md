# Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactor
Refactoring page for Accessibility Standards-HW1

## Goals of this project
In accoradance with the user marketing company and in following the guidelines set forth from the homework assignment, this file contains a rework of the Horiseon marketing website to make it more accessible. In doing so I have done my best with my current ability to meet these requests.

## Summary of rework
The website was given a concise title.
The html semantics were updated throughout for a more readable flow. 
The header nav bar follows the page to allow for quick links at any point in the page.
Images were given descriptive alt attributes to allow more accessibility.
The CSS language was updated to reflect the change in html semantics.
CSS was reordered to match the order of html.
Like features were condensed in CSS to save space and remove redundancy. 
Finally, notations were added throughout to guide with updates made and guide for future improvements.
